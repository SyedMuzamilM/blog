WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex, bidirectional communication channel over a single, long-lived connection between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are request-response based and involve the client sending a request and the server responding with data, WebSockets enable both the client and the server to send data to each other at any time, without the need for a new request-response cycle.

Here are the key characteristics of WebSockets:

1. **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets are designed for real-time communication. They allow for instant data exchange between the client and the server, making them suitable for applications that require timely updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, collaborative tools, and live data feeds.
2. **Persistent Connection**: Once a WebSocket connection is established, it remains open as long as both the client and server are active. This persistent connection eliminates the overhead of opening and closing connections for every communication, reducing latency and improving efficiency.
3. **Full-Duplex Communication**: Full-duplex communication means that both the client and server can send and receive data simultaneously over the same connection. This is in contrast to traditional HTTP, which is half-duplex and requires alternating between sending and receiving.
4. **Low Latency**: WebSockets provide low-latency communication, which means that data can be sent and received quickly without significant delays. This low latency is essential for applications where real-time interaction is crucial.
Efficient: WebSockets are efficient in terms of both data transmission and server resources. The connection overhead is minimal compared to opening new HTTP connections for every request.
5. **Cross-Domain Support**: WebSockets can be used across different domains, provided the server supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or other appropriate security mechanisms.
To initiate a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request to the server. Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send data using the WebSocket API. Data can be sent in either text or binary format.

WebSocket communication is initiated through JavaScript in the browser, and the server needs to support WebSocket connections. Popular backend frameworks and libraries often provide WebSocket support, making it relatively easy to implement real-time features in web applications.

WebSockets have revolutionized the way real-time communication is achieved on the web, enabling developers to build interactive and dynamic applications that provide timely updates and a more engaging user experience.
