In the previous article, I introduced you to the Binary Number system. If you have not read that article [click here](https://www.blackkalu.com/blog/introduction-to-binary-numbers). In that article, I introduced binary numbers, the conversion of decimal and binary numbers, and talked about some applications of the binary number system. I didnâ€™t talk about how negative numbers are represented in the binary number system, that is what I am going to explain in this article.

Since [binary numbers](https://www.blackkalu.com/blog/introduction-to-binary-numbers) can have only two digits/symbols either 0 or 1,it is not possible to add minus or plus symbol in front of a binary number.

In a decimal number, we add a minus symbol in front of a number if it is negative. In computer systems, we represent a negative and positive number by adding an extra bit in front of them called a sign bit. If the bit is 0 then the number is positive else if the bit is 1 then the number is negative.

## Ways to represent negative numbers in binary number system
There are several ways to represent negative numbers in binary which include:

Sign and magnitude representation, One's complement representation, and Two's complement method. These are explained below:

### 1. Sign and Magniture Representation

In this method the leftmost bit is used to indicate the sign of a number which is called a sign bit. The value of sign bit is 1 for negative numbers and 0 for positive numbers. The remaining bits are used to represent the magnitude of the number.

Let's suppose we have a 4-bit number, we can represent the positive number 5 as 0101, and the negative number -5 as 1101. We convert this binary number into its decimal equivalent by performing the binary to decimal conversion we learned in the [previous article](https://www.blackkalu.com/blog/introduction-to-binary-numbers), but remember to convert the sign bit and apply the appropriate sign to the result.

This method has an ambiguous representation of the number 0, which means 0 has two different representations one is +0 (0000 in 4-bit binary number) and another is -0 (1000 in 4-bit binary number)

### 2. One's Complement Representation

In order to get One's complement of a binary number, simply invert all the bits of the number. That means converting all the 0's into 1 and all 1's into 0. Let's understand this using an example. Suppose there is a binary number 11000101, then its one's complement will be 00111010.

Always remember that the leftmost bit or MSB (Most Significant Bit) is always 1 for negative numbers. So in order to represent a negative number in binary we take one's complement of that binary number.

This method has also an ambiguous representation of the number 0, which means 0 has two different representations one is +0 (0000 in 4-bit binary number) and another is -0 (1111 in 4-bit binary number)

### 3. Two's Complement Representation

In order to get Two's complement of a binary number, simply invert all the bits of the number. That means converting all the 0's into 1 and all 1's into 0 and then add 1 to this number. In other words, we can say, take the one's complement of the number and add 1 to it. Let's understand this using an example. Suppose there is a binary number 11000101, then its one's complement will be 00111010. After adding 1 to this number it will become 00111011.

**In this method there is only one representation of +0 and -0, so, two's complement representation is better than sign and magnitude representation and one's complement**
